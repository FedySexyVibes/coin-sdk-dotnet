# COIN Number Portability C# SDK Samples

For extensive documentation of the C# Number Portability SDK, please have a look at the following [README](https://gitlab.com/verenigingcoin-public/coin-sdk-java/blob/master/number-portability-sdk/README.md).

# Configure Example
In order to successfully run the tests, `private-key.pem` and `sharedkey.encrypted` have to be located in this directory.
Furthermore, the correct operator code and consumer name should be assigned to the variables `Operator` and `consumer` in  the `Tests` class.
The `SendConfirmation()` test also has a variable `messageId` that needs to be assigned.
